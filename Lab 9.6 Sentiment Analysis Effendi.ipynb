      "I wasn't the least bit interested.  \t0\n",
      "Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \t0\n",

      "This movie totally grates on my nerves.  \t0\n",
      "The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \t0\n",
      "And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \t0\n",
      "Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t0\n",

      "The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \t1\n",

      "But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  \t1\n",
      "The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \t1\n",
      "The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  \t0\n",
      "The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \t0\n",
      "), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  \t0\n",
      "The directing seems too pretentious.  \t0\n",
      "The scenes with the oh-so-mature neighbour-girl are a misplace.  \t0\n",
      "And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \t0\n",

      "It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  \t1\n",
      "However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  \t0\n",
      "There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \t0\n",

      "I saw Mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  \t0\n",
      "Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \t0\n",
      "These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \t0\n",
      "All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  \t0\n",

      "This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  \t1\n",

      "It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \t0\n",
      "NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \t0\n",

      "I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \t0\n",
      "This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  \t0\n",

      "Highly unrecommended.  \t0\n",
      "If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  \t0\n",
      "Yes, it's that bad.  \t0\n",
      "Nothing at all to recommend.  \t0\n",
      "An excellent performance from Ms.  \t1\n",
      "Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  \t1\n",
      "It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  \t1\n",
      "This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  \t0\n",
      "There were too many close ups.  \t0\n",
      "But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  \t0\n",

      "You'll love it!  \t1\n",
      "This movie is BAD.  \t0\n",
      "So bad.  \t0\n",

      "The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  \t1\n",
      "John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  \t1\n",
      "His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  \t1\n",
      "I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  \t1\n",
      "I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  \t0\n",
      "I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  \t0\n",
      "It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  \t0\n",
      "Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \t0\n",
      "Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  \t1\n",
      "His performance is simply genius.  \t1\n",
      "He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.  \t1\n",
      " In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \t1\n",
      "Ray Charles is legendary.  \t1\n",
      "Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \t1\n",
      "Hitchcock is a great director.  \t1\n",
      "Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \t0\n",
      "Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \t1\n",
      "It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \t0\n",
      "Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \t0\n",
      "The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \t0\n",
      "There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \t0\n",
      "Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  \t0\n",
      "This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \t0\n",
      "The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \t0\n",
      "And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \t0\n",
      "He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \t0\n",
      "Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \t0\n",
      "When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \t1\n",
      "I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \t1\n",
      "However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \t0\n",
      "I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \t0\n",
      "The character developments also lacked in depth.  \t0\n",
      "Woa, talk about awful.  \t0\n",
      "Do not waste your time.  \t0\n",
      "It was just too horrible.  \t0\n",
      "The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \t0\n",
      "But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \t0\n",
      "The poor actors.  \t0\n",
      "You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \t0\n",
      "If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  \t0\n",
      "This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \t0\n",
      "If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \t1\n",
      "The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \t1\n",
      "Regrettably, the film fails.  \t0\n",
      "The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \t0\n",
      "No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \t0\n",
      "Yet, I enjoy watching it.  \t1\n",
      "Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \t0\n",
      "Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \t0\n",
      "The dialogue sucked.  \t0\n",
      "The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \t0\n",
      "The soundtrack sucked.  \t0\n",
      "The acting sucked.  \t0\n",
      "The concert sequences just sucked.  \t0\n",
      "That was nice.  \t1\n",
      "That was funny.  \t1\n",
      "It was so funny.  \t1\n",
      "Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  \t0\n",
      "But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \t0\n",
      "I came out of it feeling angry.  \t0\n",
      "***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \t1\n",
      "The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \t1\n",
      "Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \t1\n",
      "And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \t1\n",
      "All things considered, a job very well done.  \t1\n",
      "Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \t1\n",
      "One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \t1\n",
      "It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \t1\n",
      "The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \t1\n",
      "It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \t1\n",
      "Up there with the best of Melville.  \t1\n",
      "Everything about this film is simply incredible.  \t1\n",
      "You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \t1\n",
      "BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \t1\n",
      "The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \t1\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \t1\n",
      "I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \t0\n",
      "If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \t0\n",
      "There is a lot of beautiful places.  \t1\n",
      "It was forced, like everything in this movie.  \t0\n",
      "Again, lame.  \t0\n",
      "Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \t0\n",

      "Really bad.  \t0\n",
      "Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  \t0\n",
      "Camerawork - again, bad.  \t0\n",

      "And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \t1\n",
      "I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \t1\n",
      "I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \t1\n",

      "All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  \t1\n",
      "I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \t0\n",
      "But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.  \t0\n",
      "To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \t0\n",
      "One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  \t0\n",
      "This is such a fun and funny movie.  \t1\n",
      "Highly entertaining at all angles.  \t1\n",

      "But Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \t1\n",
      "The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \t1\n",
      "Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  \t1\n",

      "This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  \t1\n",
      "A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \t1\n",
      "But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \t1\n",
      "It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  \t1\n",

      "I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  \t1\n",
      "I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \t0\n",
      "He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  \t0\n",
      "Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \t1\n",
      "Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  \t1\n",

      "This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  \t0\n",
      "The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \t0\n",
      "The least said about the acting the better.  \t0\n",
      "This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \t1\n",

      "Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \t1\n",
      "However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \t1\n",
      "Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \t1\n",
      "Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \t0\n",

      "Raw and sublimely moving.  \t1\n",

      "A standout scene.  \t1\n",
      "This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  \t0\n",
      "Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  \t1\n",

      "As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  \t1\n",
      "This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  \t1\n",
      "The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  \t1\n",
      "This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  \t1\n",

      "Avoid at ALL costs!  \t0\n",
      "Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  \t0\n",
      "The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  \t0\n",
      "The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \t0\n",
      "The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  \t0\n",

      "Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  \t1\n",
      "This film offers many delights and surprises.  \t1\n",
      "When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  \t1\n",
      "The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  \t1\n",
      "You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  \t1\n",

      "The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  \t1\n",
      "The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  \t1\n",
