      "\n",
      "1. You have *far* too many comments. And most of them don't tell me anything useful. If I see a line that starts with `btn.place(...)`, I don't need a comment like `# Set the position of the button.` to figure out what that line does. Comments like that are just noise.\n",
      "2. You have too much module-level code. 99% of your code should be inside of functions. This makes the code reusable (by calling the relevant function), and also neatly organizes the code into chunks with a specific purpose, which aids readability. (It's a really big deal that functions have *names*. If I see a `def create_window():`, I immediately have a pretty good idea of what the code in that function does. Naming things is really important.)\n",
      "3. Some variables don't have PEP8-compliant names, like `btn_startX` (should be `btn_start_x`).\n",
      "4. Setting the window to a specific size and placing widgets at specific pixel coordinates is a *waaaaaaay* outdated way of creating GUIs. What if someone uses a larger font size than you? Your whole GUI will be messed up. What if someone wants to resize the window? You don't allow them to do that. Instead of `place`, use the `grid` and `pack` geometry managers.\n",
      "5. Your code would benefit from some empty lines. For example, the entire `calculate` function is one massive block of text. Insert some empty lines to organize the code into logical chunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're interested, you can also check out this article I wrote about [writing readable code](https://aran-fey.github.io/programming-guides/readable-code.html). You can see there how readable your code can get if you organize it into a bunch of short functions.\n",
      "Your commenting is way overboard. `main_window.title` doesn't need a comment to explain that it sets the title, and shouldn't have a comment. Code should be self documenting, the names of functions and variables explaining what is happening. Comments should be used as infrequently as possible, and you should feel ashamed when you write them because it means that your code is written badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "`.grid` would in fact be better here. Instead of having to do pixel calculations you defer that to tkinter and just tell it the layout rather than specific positions. To have the *Entry* widget across the whole top you would put the buttons in a *Frame*, which can be positioned below the *Entry* widget. Instead of pixel calculations you end up with\n",

You could get two different results from calling a function with the same arguments. Instead pass `output` into the function as well\n",
      "\n",

      "At the end , you can use an fstring to print everything.\n",
      "You’ll want to create a variable that holds a tuple for each product. Considering your example seems to allow for multiple products, you’ll want to use a while loop to generate more than one tuple. If you want your tuples to print on the same line, you can store them in a list and then print the list. If that doesn’t matter, just print them within the while loop. For the last part where you categorize the products, you’ll want some kind of variable for those categories too (i.e. if a product is soap, you add 1 to soap.)\n",
      "Yeah, python can do that. There's libraries for accessing databases, but without knowing what you use I can't recommend anything specific. To build the ui you have a few options. tkinter and simplegui are easy to learn, but a little restricted on the overall look of the ui. pyqt gives you a lot more freedom but is more complex.
